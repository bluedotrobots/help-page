# ðŸ§­ What is Blue Dot's mission?

Technology should inspire, not intimidate. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re breaking barriers to STEM education - making robotics something anyone can access, understand, and love.

At Blue Dot, we're not just teaching robotics - we're unlocking human potential. As the world grows increasingly  automated, mechanized, and motorized, today's education systems struggle to keep pace. We're bridging that gap.&#x20;

Blue Dot Robots is inspiring the next generation of problem-solvers, dreamers, and builders. Because when people are empowered to create, the future becomes limitless.
