# ‚ùî What is Blue Dot Robots?

## Pip

Every detail of Pip is crafted with one purpose: to let you _just keep building_. Pip's setup is frictionless - no wires, no complicated instructions, no hours of setup. **Just connect to Wi-Fi, and you're ready to go.**

Once your Pip is online, explore the [Lab](https://bluedotrobots.com/lab), where interactive lessons and challenges guide you step by step. Feeling adventurous? Head on over to the [Sandbox](https://bluedotrobots.com/sandbox), where you can take full control of your Pip and bring your ideas to life.

## Blue Dot Robots

At Blue Dot Robots, we believe in learning by doing. Here, practice finally meets theory. Our platform encourages experimentation and builds confidence and curiosity for STEM.&#x20;

Unlike in a classroom, learners set their own pace with Pip. They're given the autonomy to create, fail, and try again - developing resilience along the way.

We're opening up the door to discovery and holding it wide open for everyone.

This is Blue Dot Robots.
