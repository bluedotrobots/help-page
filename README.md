# ðŸ¤– About Us

The idea for Pip emerged out of our frustrations with educational robotics products growing up. They typically fell into one of two categories:

1. Onboarding friction: Even basic projects, like getting an Arduino to blink an LED, often requires hours of setup and troubleshooting for newcomers.
2. Static curriculum: Current robotics programs use rigid, age-bracketed learning tracks (e.g. 7-10 years, 11-14 years). Engaged learners quickly outgrow the limited available content.

We thought these problems wouldâ€™ve been solved by now, so we purchased a few educational robots just to make sure. After each purchase, we came closer to realizing that **progress and innovation in robotics education has stagnated over the last 10-15 years**.

We set out on building a product that breaks down both barriers by:

1. Not requiring any assembly, and providing a frictionless onboarding experience
2. Creating an interactive web-based robotics curriculum thatâ€™s integrated with Pip

[Our mission](mission.md) is to provide an accessible, world-class robotics education, and every decision we make is in service of advancing that goal.

We love hearing your feedback and helping with whatever we can. Whether you have a question, need assistance, or just want to share your thoughts, we're here for you. For any inquiries, please reach out to us at bluedotrobots@gmail.com
